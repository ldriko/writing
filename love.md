**What is love?**

Yet to discover.

**Pleaser & Anxiety**

Being somewhat of a people pleaser and having a desperation of receiving love
from others will makes us more easily agitated or anxious. In my personal
experience, I always thrive on making the outcome of things I worked on to be as
great as it can be while subconsciously didn't want to let down other people at
the same time. This kind of anxiety started growing in me when I was younger
where I had to do things that I don't feel to do yet I still have to, cause if I
don't, the most important thing would struggle which in this case was my family.

Having this way of doing things all this time made me become more aware of what 
it's postive and negative effect, which are:
- Positive:
  - I work harder
  - Become more persistent
  - ...
- Negative:
  - ...

Kind of silly, but a friend of mine made me aware of these topic when she was
having an issue on her relationship with her boyfriend. She said that she want 
to be more "loved" and she felt that she wasn't deserved to be loved and to be
a great friend, I thought on how to make her feel better. *~To be continued!*

What I found to be the most important personal traits is awareness. By being
aware *~To be continued!*
